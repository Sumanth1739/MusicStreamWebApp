2. Add album art in the `images/` folder.
3. Update the `songs` array in `script.js` with the file paths:

```javascript
const songs = [
  {
    title: "Dreams",
    file: "songs/dreams.mp3",
    cover: "images/dreams.jpg"
  },
  ...
];

Do you want me to:
✅ **Include this README directly inside the project folder as `README.md`**?
✅ And shall I also **complete the full app code (HTML, CSS, JS)** with 5 demo songs and placeholder album arts? So you can copy and run it directly?
